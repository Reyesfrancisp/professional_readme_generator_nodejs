# Professional README Generator

  ## Description

My project aims to create an application running entirely in node.js, by using requires for the FS and Inquirer packages. By using the example templates of what a professioanl README should look like, I was able to discern the logic behind creating each section in node and then generating the corresponding output file. Using the FS and Inquirer packages to handle writing a file as well as prompting the user through the console, I was able to generate a template that takes in the user input from scratch. Then I went through the process of adding test cases and making sure that there was still an output even when the user didn't enter any information. The project now generates a template for a readme file based on all the acceptance criteria mentioned in the module.
